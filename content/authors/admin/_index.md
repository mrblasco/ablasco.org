I work at the [Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard](lish.harvard.edu) and at the [Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](broadinstitute.org), where I investigate the impact of digital transformation on science and the way firms innovate. I lead several [crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) projects to see whether one can use online competitions to advance science (see [this paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0222165) for example). The most exciting of which was [this data-science competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa), where we solicited deep learning algorithms to study how human cells respond to drug treatments in vitro. 

As a social scientist, my research interests focus on understanding how people respond to incentives in such competitive environments. My favorite research strategy is to use [field experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_experiment) to test behavioral hypotheses in the real world. For example, see [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167268119300599) on a field experiment run at the [Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org) in Boston to see why people contribute ideas to improve their organization.
